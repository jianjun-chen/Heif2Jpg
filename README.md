# Heif2Jpg
HEIF is the new photo format that Apple is using to replace JPEG. And it probably will replace JPEGs, because the iPhone is the most popular, most-used camera in the world, and as of iOS 11, most iPhones will be switching from JPEG to HEIF.

This tool is to convert Heif files(*.heic) to Jpg files.  It is for windows, UI based file or directory selection, and convert the files to JPG by using libheif(https://github.com/strukturag/libheif).

This tool has no advertising, no plugin, no virus, no installation. 

It is free.
